This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to include the `requirements.txt` file in the image. The initial `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python packages using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but the `requirements.txt` file is missing. This results in a build failure.  The solution provides a corrected `Dockerfile` that includes the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring a successful build.
